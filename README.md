# Automated Student ID Extraction Project

## Overview
This project aims to develop a Python-based system that utilizes OpenCV and SVM to automatically extract and recognize student IDs from images. The system involves several stages, including image preprocessing, contour detection and filtering, and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to accurately identify and display student IDs on input images.

## Features
- **Image Preprocessing**: Converts images to grayscale, applies Gaussian blur, and performs adaptive thresholding.
- **Contour Detection**: Identifies and processes contours to isolate characters.
- **Character Recognition**: Uses SVM for training and predicting characters from images.
- **Automated Extraction**: Extracts and displays student IDs accurately on the input images.
